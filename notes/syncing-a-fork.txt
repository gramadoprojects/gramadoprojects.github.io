Syncing a fork

Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

-----------------
Steps:

+ Specify a new remote [NEW] repository that will be synced with the fork.
  git remote -v
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY

+ Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the [NEW] repository. 
  git fetch [NEW]
  example: git fetch upstream

+ Check out your fork's local default branch.
  git checkout master


+ Merge the changes from the [NEW] default branch.
  git merge [NEW]/main
  example:   git merge upstream/main
